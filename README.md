# boilerplate
This project will help you setup a dot net core solution with the following boiler plate projects:
* Models
* Repository
* MVC UI

Pre requisites:
* Linux operating system.  The shell script runs in bash
* Git should be installed
* Dot Net 8 SDK - this might work with other versions of dot net but I have not tried it with any other versions
